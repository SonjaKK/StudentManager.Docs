## **What is a Qualification**

### **Introduction**

- A Qualification in this system is basically a learning programme

- A learner would be enrolled/registered into this programme and based on certain institution rules, would be deemed competent in all subject matter and at the end awarded with something to recognize that they have achieved the requirements of the programme and are then awarded the qualification

- Learning programmes have various governing bodies which they would fall under and according to various internal or external quality assurance policies, these would be accredited

 

### **Some South African examples of learning programmes/qualifications**

- If in our system you have an accredited, South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) accredited, programme with the Council for Higher Education, for example, information related to this can be stored in the system. For the most part, these include programmes which have also been vetted by the National Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET).

- Institutions may have other types of accredited SAQA programs, registered through Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETA's), Quality Council for Trades and Occupations (QCTO) or Council for Quality Assurance in General and Further Education and Training (UMALUSI), these are also catered for in our system

- The last category may be short courses or informal programmes which are not registered with SAQA but are maybe just "in-house" learning certifications, for institutions or organisations


### **What is a qualification made up of?**

- The overall qualification is the sum total of the smaller learning building blocks which make up the learners knowledge an understanding, in the system, we refer to these as modules, some others may call these subjects

- The modules are placed inside a learning framework or learning path which allows the learner to be exposed to module content in sequence. We refer to this learning framework as a curriculum

- Within a qualification, there will be a curriculum with modules. In addition to this learner will apply to study this qualification and the be registered in modules against the qualification

- So the Qualification is made of  Curriculum (containing modules), Applications and Registrations
